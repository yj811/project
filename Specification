Specification of Equations
Equations is a variant of Wff'n Proof created in 1965, four years after Wff'n Proof had been
invented. Instead of using symbols, the game uses 24 cubes labelling with numbers and
mathematical equations. A mat is divided into Forbidden, Permitted and Required sections. To win
this game, players sets a goal(a mathematical equation) at the beginning of a game and using the
cubes to get the result.
1. Objectives
• An up-to-date Android multi-player game (normally 2-3 people but this version any number)
• Run on most Android platforms, setting Android sdk at a low level for more players
• Concurrent game which means that multiple games running at the same time acceptable
• More if time: AI player, web-based, cross-platform
2. Functions to achieve
Before a game starts:
• Players can either play as a guest or create accounts
• Players can either create a game, set a password of the table and kick others out or
join an existing waiting game
• Players can create own rules which must be accepted by all other players
• Share the game via Facebook, Google+
During a game：
• Players can leave in the middle of a game with a penalty and send a message to others.
The game will continue unless only one player is left.
• Players can chat with each other
After a game ends
• Players can wait for a new game starts
• Players can leave and create a new game
Besides, the game should have the ability to check the validity of the equations created by players.
Task management
I split the project into back-end and front-end. client-side and server-side. I will make use of
database systems and a simple Android game engine(cocos2d) to make better graphics and
simulation. For the UI design, the project is going to have a login screen, a main screen, a game
board and a waiting screen for players to wait for a game to start.
